## Overview
The data was collect from participents smart phones. Thirty volunteers ages 19-48 were used to collect various information using the accelerometer and gryoscope in their phones. Certain summary data means and standard deviations for each activity and individual has been further summerized. There were multiple data points for each activity and individual pair; we have taken the average of these samples.

## Variarble description

###  subjectId
     The data were collected from 30 individuals each individual is identified only by an integer in the range 1 to 30 

### activity
    The name and discription of the activity being monitored
         walking
         walking upstairs
         walking downstairs
         sitting
         standing
         laying

### activityIndex
